# AI-Based-Reconnaissance-Identification-System
🔍 Overview
This project is an AI-powered reconnaissance system that detects and classifies objects (people, vehicles, or suspicious items) in real time using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It is designed for security and surveillance applications, automatically identifying potential threats and unauthorized objects.

🎯 Features
✅ Real-time object detection using pre-trained deep learning models (YOLO/MobileNet SSD)
✅ Works on live webcam feed or pre-recorded video
✅ Bounding box visualization to highlight detected objects
✅ Preprocessing techniques like noise reduction and contrast adjustment for better accuracy
✅ Can be extended to send alerts for detected threats
